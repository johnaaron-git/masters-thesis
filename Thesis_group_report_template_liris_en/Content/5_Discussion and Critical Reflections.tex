\subsection{Future Directions}
create an explainer for anomaly detection in Dynamic graphs (for expl EvolveGCN)
create data repo for temporal graphs
merge PyGeoTemp and Py GOD

REALLY cool stuff: Catching up to modern credit card fraud models but with real explainability... streaming live heterogenous graph data into dynamic [black-box] models, connected to timestep-aware explainers.

\subsection{Contribution}
1)A survey on explainability in Dynamic Graphs
2)Showing current shortcomings in performance and explainability (GNN vs ML, static vs dynamic, homegenous vs heterogenous) --> simple often better
3) Help to create a new explainer for anomaly detection in dynamic graph ( 3 datasets, survey, advices,...)
