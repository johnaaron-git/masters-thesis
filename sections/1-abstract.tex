This thesis provides a taxonomic overview of currently available explainability (explainable, explainer, interpretable, interpretability) methods in dynamic graph anomaly detection. Our overview documents and evaluates both the underlying mechanisms and applications of these methods based on explanation type, dynamic modification, model-specific evaluation metrics, transparency, supervision, and code availability. It also addresses underlying challenges, suggests directions for future research, and provides both explanations and recommendations for an experimental method.
